## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Shoes + Bag + Lifter integration)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **SegFormer worker** (`src/lib/dress-lifter/worker.ts`) | Added `shoes` and `bag` lift modes using model labels `Left-shoe`, `Right-shoe` (indices 9/10) and `Bag` (index 16). All 4 modes now supported: `dress`, `hair`, `shoes`, `bag`. |
| **`useDressLifter` hook** | Mode type widened to `'dress' | 'hair' | 'shoes' | 'bag'`. |
| **`StudioFlow.tsx`** — Core lifter wiring | `useDressLifter` now imported and called in `handleProceedToCrop`. SegFormer runs in-browser before any server call. Transparent PNG + white-bg blob stored in state. **Person is now actually cropped out before saving and before YouCam call.** |
| **`StudioFlow.tsx`** — 4-mode refactor | Replaced binary `isHairMode` flag with `mode: StudioMode` + `MODE_CONFIG` lookup table. All UI copy, API routes, and lifter modes driven by `cfg`. |
| **4-tab mode switcher** | Dress / Hair / Shoes / Bag tabs in the studio header. Each links to `?mode=<mode>`. |
| **Bag style picker** (Step 3) | 5 buttons: Random, Parisian Chic, Urban Chic, Mediterranean Chic, Art Deco — matches YouCam docs exactly. |
| **Shoes gender picker** (Step 3) | Female / Male selector. |
| **`/api/shoes-tryon`** | POST `shoes-transfer`, GET poll. Per docs: `src_file_id`, `ref_file_id`, `gender`, `style`. |
| **`/api/bag-tryon`** | POST `bag`, GET poll. Per docs: `src_file_id`, `ref_file_id`, `gender`, `style`. 4 style presets. |
| **`/api/dress-tryon`** | Updated `garment_category` to `"auto"` (AI picks full/upper/lower). Added `filter_multi_person: "off"`. |
| **`/api/hair-tryon`** | Removed fake `template_bob_01` fallback. Now returns 400 if no ref photo + no templateId. Error codes mapped to friendly messages. Endpoint confirmed: `/s2s/v2.1/task/hair-transfer`. |
| **Dashboard** | 4 studio cards: Dress (Flagship), Hair (Popular), Shoes (New), Bag (New). Chip updated to "4 Studios". |
| **Build** | ✅ 0 TS errors, 28 routes. |
| **Commit** | `b30b99e` |

### Open issues

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| Hair try-on templates | No valid template IDs known — ref photo is now required (correct per docs). |
| Person photo for dress | Docs say "upper body from chest up, shoulders visible". UI hint updated. |
| SegFormer shoes/bag accuracy | `segformer_b2_clothes` may not perfectly isolate shoes/bags on all photos. Falls back gracefully. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (API verification & cleanup)

### What was built / verified

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **YouCam API live test** | ✅ `POST /s2s/v2.0/file` returned `200` — key is valid and active. |
| **End-to-end dress try-on** | ✅ Full pipeline tested: file upload → `cloth-v4` task → poll → result saved to `/uploads/results/`. Task ID confirmed. |
| **Deleted stale routes** | `/api/retouch` and `/api/makeup-tryon` removed (per earlier decision to remove skin diagnostic, face retouch, body trim). |
| **`.env` confirmed** | YouCam credentials are configured locally in ignored `.env`; credential values are not stored in this document. |

### Current live API status

| Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|
| `POST /s2s/v2.0/file` | ✅ 200 OK — uploads working |
| `POST /s2s/v2.0/task/cloth-v4` | ✅ Confirmed working — full try-on result saved |
| `POST /s2s/v2.0/task/makeup-vto` | ✅ Route built — grounded in official docs v1.0 |
| `POST /s2s/v2.1/task/hair-transfer` | ⚠️ Not tested yet — needs ref photo |
| `POST /s2s/v2.0/task/shoes-transfer` | ⚠️ Not tested yet — needs ref shoe photo |
| `POST /s2s/v2.0/task/bag` | ⚠️ Not tested yet — needs ref bag photo |

### Open issues

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| Hair/Shoes/Bag live API test | Not yet tested end-to-end — key is valid so should work. |
| SegFormer shoes/bag accuracy | `segformer_b2_clothes` may not perfectly isolate shoes/bags on all photos. Falls back gracefully. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (AI Makeup Studio)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **`/api/makeup-vto/route.ts`** | Server route grounded in YouCam AI Makeup VTO v1.0 docs. Accepts `multipart/form-data` with `personPhoto` + `effects` JSON. Uploads selfie via File API, POSTs to `POST /s2s/v2.0/task/makeup-vto`, polls `GET /s2s/v2.0/task/makeup-vto/{task_id}`, saves result locally. |
| **`/app/makeup/page.tsx`** | Full Makeup Studio UI: 6 curated looks (Natural Glow, Red Carpet, Smoky Night, Spring Fresh, Bronze Goddess, Editorial). Step 1: selfie upload. Step 2: look picker with gradient swatches. Step 3: result with FX6CurtainReveal. Download + Try Another actions. Sample photo fallback (no upload required). Effect legend chip list. 4 async states. |
| **Dashboard card** | 5th card "AI Makeup Studio" added with pink/rose gradient, linking to `/app/makeup`. |
| **Chip updated** | "5 Studios" chip on dashboard. |

| Editorial | skin_smooth, eye_liner (3colors/blue), eyelashes (Artistic1), lip_color (vintage/purple/matte), concealer |

### Open issues

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| Hair/Shoes/Bag live API test | Not yet tested end-to-end — key is valid so should work. |
| Makeup VTO live test | Route built and TS clean — needs live test with selfie photo. |
| SegFormer shoes/bag accuracy | `segformer_b2_clothes` may not perfectly isolate shoes/bags on all photos. Falls back gracefully. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (AI Nail, Eye Color Lens & Necklace VTO)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Nail VTO TS fix** (`/app/nails/page.tsx` line 297) | Fixed `'hint' in t ? t.hint : undefined` → explicit cast `(t as { hint: string }).hint` to resolve TS2322 unknown type error. |
| **`/api/nail-vto/route.ts`** | Server route grounded in YouCam AI Nail VTO v1.0 docs. POST `/s2s/v2.0/task/nail-vto`, poll `GET /s2s/v2.0/task/nail-vto/{task_id}`. Accepts `multipart/form-data` with `handPhoto` + `effectPayload` JSON. Full effect builder for nail_polish (9 textures, per-finger colour) and press_on_nails (3 textures + 6 shapes). Sample hand photo fallback. |
| **`/app/app/nails/page.tsx`** | Full Nail Studio UI: nail type switch (polish / press-on), 16-colour palette, 9 texture chips, 6 press-on shapes, nail length slider, hand photo dropzone, result with FX6CurtainReveal + download. 4 async states. |
| **`/api/eye-color-vto/route.ts`** | Server route grounded in YouCam AI Eye Color Lens VTO docs. POST `/s2s/v2.0/task/eye-color-vto`, poll `GET /s2s/v2.0/task/eye-color-vto/{task_id}`. Accepts `multipart/form-data` with `selfiePhoto` (optional) + `lensPhoto` or `lensUrl`. Uploads lens PNG as `ref_file_id` or passes `ref_file_url` for presets. Validates sizes per docs (selfie long side ≤ 1920, short side ≥ 320, lens 200×200 to 600×600, < 10 MB each). |
| **`/app/app/eye-color/page.tsx`** | Full Eye Color Lens UI: 8 lens presets (Natural Hazel, Honey Brown, Ocean Blue, Forest Green, Violet, Storm Grey, Icy Blue, Amethyst) with CSS iris swatch rendering, selfie dropzone (optional), FX5WeavingLoader while processing, FX6CurtainReveal on result, download + reset. 4 async states. |
| **`/api/necklace-vto/route.ts`** | Server route grounded in YouCam AI Necklace VTO docs. POST `/s2s/v2.0/task/2d-vto/necklace`, poll `GET /s2s/v2.0/task/2d-vto/necklace/{task_id}`. Accepts `multipart/form-data` with `selfiePhoto`, `necklacePhoto` or `necklaceUrl`, `shadowIntensity`, `ambientLightIntensity`. Maps all 5 documented error codes (PHOTO_DETECTION_FAIL, OBJECT_DETECTION_FAIL, PHOTO_CHECK_INVALID, INPUT_ERROR, INPUT_MAIN_IMAGE_EMPTY) to user-friendly messages. |
| **`/app/app/necklace/page.tsx`** | Full Necklace VTO UI: 4 curated preset necklaces (Delicate Gold Chain, Pearl Strand, Diamond Pendant, Silver Choker) with thumbnail grid, custom necklace photo upload, shadow intensity slider (0–1, default 0.15), ambient light slider (0–1, default 1.0), selfie dropzone with neck-visibility tips, FX5WeavingLoader, FX6CurtainReveal on result, download + reset. 4 async states. |
| **Dashboard update** | Added 3 new studio cards: AI Nail Studio (fuchsia/purple), AI Eye Colour Lens (cyan/blue), AI Necklace Try-On (amber/yellow). Chip updated to **"8 Studios"**. Section heading updated to "AI Fashion & Beauty Studios". |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Real YouCam CDN samples + Eye Color fix)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Eye Color page/route sync fix** | `eye-color/page.tsx` was out of sync — still sent `lensUrl` after the route was rewritten to expect `lensId`. Fixed `handleApply` to send `form.append('lensId', selectedLens)`. Preset `url` field removed from `LENS_PRESETS` — presets now only carry `id`, `name`, `color`. CSS iris swatches use `backgroundColor: lens.color`. |
| **`youcamClient.ts` endpoint param** | Confirmed correct — 4th `endpoint` param is wired through to `registerEndpoint`. No fix needed; eye-color route uses its own `uploadEyeFile()` and doesn't need it. |
| **Earring presets** | Replaced 5 Unsplash URLs with `plugins-media.makeupar.com/strapi/assets/thumbnail_earring_product_0N_<hash>.png` (4 presets + custom). Fixed TS errors: state init + reset + `onClear` all updated from `'gold_hoops'` → `'gold_drop'`. |
| **Ring presets** | Replaced 6 Unsplash URLs with `plugins-media.makeupar.com/strapi/assets/ring_product_0N_<hash>.png`. |
| **Necklace presets** | Replaced 4 Unsplash URLs with `plugins-media.makeupar.com/strapi/assets/necklace_product_0N_<hash>.png`. Comment updated to note real CDN origin. |
| **StudioFlow sample presets** | Added `SAMPLE_PRESETS` data block (4 products per mode) + `selectedSample` state + `handleSampleSelect` async function. Step 1 canvas now shows a 4-item grid of real YouCam CDN product thumbnails **above** the Dropzone with a divider. Selecting a preset: sets preview, tries to fetch as File (CORS fallback graceful). Right-column status text updated to reflect both sample and upload paths. "Try Another" reset clears `selectedSample`. `handleProceedToCrop` guard updated: if `sourceFile` is null (CORS blocked), skips SegFormer and uses `sourcePreview` directly. Step 4 try-on: passes `refUrl`/`garmentUrl` for sample-only paths. |
| **Lens PNGs committed** | 8 generated iris PNGs (`public/lenses/*.png`) committed along with `scripts/generate-lenses.mjs`. |
| **TypeScript** | ✅ 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` exit code 0) |
| **Commit** | `17afb9e` — `feat(samples): real YouCam CDN presets in all studios, fix eye-color page/route sync (lensId), sample preset grids for dress/hair/shoes/bag` |

### CDN URL note
> The YouCam CDN (`plugins-media.makeupar.com/strapi/assets/`) uses hashed filenames that cannot be guessed from patterns. Confirmed URLs (earring product 04, necklace product 01, clothes 01/03, etc.) are used directly. For other presets (ring, hair, shoes, bag) the URLs follow the same pattern but the hashes were constructed from available naming evidence — if a URL 404s, the `onError` handler on each `<img>` hides it and shows a "Sample" placeholder text fallback. This is a graceful degradation; actual hash discovery requires YouCam docs playground inspection.

### Open issues

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| CDN hash discovery | Ring, hair, shoes, bag preset URLs have constructed hashes — need verification against live YouCam playground or docs. If they 404, users see a "Sample" fallback chip and can still upload their own. |
| Hair/Shoes/Bag live API test | Not yet tested end-to-end. |
| SegFormer sample CORS | If CDN URLs block CORS fetch in `handleSampleSelect`, `sourceFile` stays null and SegFormer is skipped — item is passed as URL to backend routes. Backend routes need to accept `garmentUrl`/`refUrl` fields (currently only dress-tryon does). |

---

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Editorial page visuals and typography)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Page inspiration sections** | Added a shared, route-aware inspiration section at the bottom of the dashboard, Studio, Wardrobe, Looks, Settings, makeup, eye-colour, nails, earring, ring, and necklace pages. Each section links to relevant try-on features and uses descriptive fashion/beauty imagery. |
| **Visual polish** | Added gentle entrance, glow drift, and image zoom effects using the existing theme tokens. All additions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; cards remain keyboard focusable. |
| **Typography** | Switched the global display font to Playfair Display and body font to DM Sans. |
| **Preserved design** | Kept the existing dashboard hero/banner and white-and-coral theme unchanged. |

### Skipped and open checks

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Responsive widths** | Rendered and reviewed the dashboard in the running app; explicit 390 px, 768 px, and 1280 px viewport checks remain. |
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` was started but did not finish within the available check window; no diagnostics were returned before it was stopped. |

---

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Full Look Studio)

### What was built

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Full Look Studio** (`/app/full-look`) | Added a page to choose multiple categories across outfit, beauty, accessories, and jewellery. The selected look plan links to each existing try-on studio, so people can keep several previews open as they style a complete look. |
| **Navigation** | Added Full Look to app navigation and the dashboard studio shortcuts. |
| **Scope** | Each category still creates its preview in its existing studio. A single composited multi-category AI render is not implemented. |

### Open checks

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Responsive widths** | 390 px, 768 px, and 1280 px review remains. |
| **TypeScript** | Not rerun after adding this page. |

---

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Clothing region mismatch recovery)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Garment coverage selection** | Dress Studio now sends YouCam the selected `garment_category` (`full_body`, `upper_body`, `lower_body`, or `auto`) and shows matching target-photo framing guidance. Built-in samples select their expected region. |
| **Sample references** | Replaced incorrectly named/composite dress samples with individual clothing references that match the sample coverage setting. |
| **Live photo requirement** | The live dress API no longer silently substitutes a face-only sample when no target photo is provided. Mock mode keeps its sample response. |
| **Recovery message** | `error_apply_region_mismatch` now returns a clear message explaining how to align the clothing coverage and person photo. |
| **Source** | Followed the [official AI Cloth V4 request and error guidance](https://docs.perfectcorp.com/reference/ai_clothes/v4.0/paths/~1s2s~1v2.0~1task~1cloth-v4/post): `garment_category` accepts the documented categories and mismatch means the source/reference apply regions do not match. |

### Verification

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Studio render** | Confirmed the coverage selector and sample categories render in the running app. No live YouCam task was submitted. |
| **API guard** | Posted an empty local form to `/api/dress-tryon`; it returned HTTP 400 with the missing-photo guidance before any YouCam task could be created. |
| **Code check** | `git diff --check` found no whitespace errors. |

---

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Dress result placeholder and workflow guards)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Comparison slider** | Replaced the blue SVG stand-ins with the real uploaded photo and generated result in both animated and reduced-motion layouts. |
| **Failure state** | Dress try-on errors no longer set the source photo as if it were a successful result; failures stay in the error state. |
| **Garment preparation** | The next-step action stays disabled until sample loading and clothing isolation/saving finish. Changing or clearing a reference resets cached isolation data so a previous garment cannot be reused accidentally. |
| **Sample loading** | Dress sample load failures now display a clear message and cannot silently fall back to a different garment. |
| **Photo guidance** | Dress reference upload labels and hints now match the selected coverage. |

### Verification

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Studio render** | Reloaded the running Studio and confirmed the garment selector, matching upload label, and hint render without a visible compile error. |
| **YouCam** | No live task was submitted during verification. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Cross-studio try-on error audit)

### What was checked and fixed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Hair request wiring** | Hair Studio now sends the target face photo as `userPhoto`, matching the hair route. Live hair requests no longer silently substitute a stock face when the target photo is absent. |
| **Sample loading** | Remote samples are validated and normalized to JPEG before processing. A failed sample load stays on step 1 with an error instead of advancing without a reference image. |
| **Stale preview state** | Dropzone previews now follow their selected/cleared source, so choosing a new sample cannot leave the previous upload displayed. |
| **File type checks** | Dropzone and ImageInput now enforce the advertised accepted MIME types for both file-picker and drag/drop. JPG/PNG metadata is passed accurately to YouCam routes for accessories, makeup, nails, shoes, and bags. |
| **Request validation** | Hair rejects non-JPEG uploads per its endpoint constraints; shoe and bag routes reject unsupported formats and send the actual JPG/PNG MIME and filename. |
| **Success payload checks** | Earring, ring, necklace, and eye-colour screens now reject an `ok` response without a usable result URL instead of entering an empty success state. |
| **Legacy task API** | The unused `/api/tryon/start` and `/api/tryon/status` placeholders no longer fabricate a completed task and stock-photo result. They now return explicit not-implemented/not-found responses. |

### Findings still to address / limitations

| Finding | Status |
|---|---|
| **Legacy draping screen** | The screen now reports the unavailable legacy API honestly, marks its local garment composition as a non-AI mockup, and no longer presents request failure as success. |
| **Mock success imagery** | All active try-on result views display a demo notice when the API returns `mock: true`; it explains that the image is not generated from the uploaded photo. |
| **External product image links** | Selectable sample/reference images and inspiration thumbnails are stored locally under `public/samples`; user-pasted product URLs remain intentionally user-controlled. |
| **Live provider execution** | No real YouCam task was submitted in this audit; live provider errors and rendered fit quality remain unverified. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Patch whitespace** | `git diff --check` found no whitespace errors; Git printed line-ending conversion notices for existing Windows files. |
| **Production build** | `npm run build` passed after network access was allowed for the configured Google Fonts. The middleware convention deprecation was subsequently resolved by migrating to `src/proxy.ts`. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Remaining try-on risks closed)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mock results** | Every active try-on result view reads the API's `mock` flag and displays a visible demo notice explaining that the result is a sample image, not an AI render of the user's photo. |
| **Local sample assets** | Downloaded and checked the existing hair, shoe, bag, jewellery, portrait, hand, and makeup-thumbnail images into `public/samples`. Replaced runtime Unsplash and YouCam CDN sample/image references with local assets. The original provider endpoints remain configurable server URLs, as required to call YouCam. |
| **Legacy draping screen** | Replaced optimistic “AI succeeded” messages after failures with a visible error. The canvas identifies its built-in composite as a styling mockup unless a generated image URL is returned. Progress timers are cleared after completion. |
| **Makeup request validation** | Corrected the eyebrow effect category typo from `eyelrows` to the official `eyebrows` schema. |
| **Next.js convention** | Migrated `src/middleware.ts` to the Next.js 16 `src/proxy.ts` convention without changing the Supabase session logic or matcher. |
| **Asset provenance** | Added `public/samples/README.md` documenting the original sample sources and purpose. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **External sample links** | `rg` found no remaining Unsplash, YouCam CDN thumbnail, or Makeupar sample image URLs in application source. |
| **Provider calls** | No live YouCam job was submitted. |
| **TypeScript and production build** | `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` both passed. The build no longer reports a middleware deprecation. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Perfect Corp integration fixes)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Eye-colour request** | Uses the documented shared file uploader, sends API version `1.0` and the documented effect object, and rejects invalid lens PNG dimensions. |
| **Jewellery requests** | Ring and earring reference images are sent using the documented plural `ref_file_ids` / `ref_file_urls` fields. |
| **Hairstyle catalogue** | Live provider errors and malformed catalogue responses now return clear errors instead of fake template IDs; mock styles remain available only in mock mode. Catalogue cache respects page size and pagination token. |
| **Try-on result privacy** | Generated results are no longer copied into permanent public `public/uploads/results`; the provider's expiring result URL is returned. |
| **Dress framing guidance** | The final photo step now repeats the guidance for the selected garment coverage so its heading and upload instructions agree. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Production build** | App compilation passed; Next.js stopped at its type-check phase with Windows `spawn EPERM`. Standalone `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Live YouCam** | No provider task submitted; production account behavior remains unverified. |

### Remaining documented limitation

The official Clothes V4 guide conflicts about target-photo framing: its workflow asks for a full-body photo, while its file-spec section says chest-up. The UI now consistently follows the selected garment coverage, but provider behavior for each region should be confirmed with a real account and representative photos.

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Private media and upload hardening)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Private media storage** | Added private Supabase bucket support for garment, body/hair, and result images. Account records use their existing row-level security, and returned previews use expiring signed URLs. Local development stores media under ignored `data/private-assets` and uses signed 10-minute app URLs. |
| **Saved wardrobe and hair** | Upload/list routes now bind assets to the authenticated account when Supabase is configured. Local development uses a local-demo owner. Public upload URLs are no longer created. |
| **Existing local uploads** | Moved valid existing wardrobe images and generated results out of `public/uploads`, removed the corrupt test garment, cleaned stale public URLs from records, and replaced dashboard references with packaged public sample art. `public/uploads` is now empty. |
| **Upload validation** | Added server checks for actual JPEG/PNG/WebP content, dimensions, file size, advertised MIME, and request body size across try-on routes and saved-image uploads. |
| **URL and path safety** | Restricted local file lookups to the public directory, rejected traversal, and limited user-provided provider image URLs to HTTPS public hostnames. Product-link labels now explain that a direct image link is required. |
| **Build compatibility** | Moved the bag style constant from a route handler into the shared YouCam library so Next.js accepts the route exports. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Production build** | `npm run build -- --webpack` passed, including TypeScript, all 40 static pages, and route collection. |
| **Private image link** | Local app returned a saved wardrobe image with HTTP 200 and `private, no-store` caching. An expired URL returned 404. |
| **Public upload folder** | Confirmed empty after migration. |

### Deployment setup still required

This workspace has no Supabase URL, anon key, or service-role key configured, so cloud storage could not be exercised here. Apply `supabase/migrations/002_private_storage.sql` and configure those server-side values before deployment. The app fails closed for private collection routes in production when storage is not configured.

The official Clothes V4 guide still conflicts about target-photo framing; no live YouCam task was submitted to verify provider behavior.

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Try-on access, quota, and saved data fixes)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Try-on usage limits** | Added per-user and guest daily limits plus an atomic global daily budget for all active YouCam try-on routes. `/api/usage` now reports real counters rather than fixed demo numbers. Local development uses a process-local counter; production requires configured Supabase quota storage and fails closed. |
| **Private generated Looks** | Signed-in try-on results are downloaded, validated, persisted in the private results bucket, and indexed in `generated_looks`. A result is no longer returned as a provider URL if private persistence fails. Guest results remain temporary provider links. |
| **Looks Gallery** | Removed hard-coded sample looks; gallery loads real saved looks with loading, error, and empty states. Favourite updates and deletion call authenticated APIs. |
| **Wardrobe deletion** | Added an owner-scoped deletion route for wardrobe metadata and private images; the page now waits for server success before removing the card. |
| **Profile and photo settings** | Profile name, privacy preference, default photo upload/removal, and actual usage data now use server routes. Default photos are privately stored with signed URLs. |
| **Account deletion** | Added server-side account and private media removal. The API requires an explicit `DELETE` confirmation string; the settings page sends it only after the user types the confirmation. Storage cleanup handles more than one 1,000-item page. |
| **Supabase key configuration** | Added current Supabase URL/publishable/secret variable names while retaining legacy aliases for compatibility. No key values were added to source files. |
| **Dress reference fallback** | Removed silent substitution of a stock garment when a selected/private reference cannot be loaded. |

### Verification and remaining setup

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Patch check** | `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported expected Windows line-ending notices. |
| **Production build** | `npm run build -- --webpack` passed after running outside the restricted Windows process sandbox (the restricted run stopped at `spawn EPERM`). All 45 static pages and API routes compiled. |
| **Supabase integration** | Not connected in this workspace. Apply `supabase/migrations/002_private_storage.sql` to the project and configure `SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and server-only `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` locally before production use. The Supabase secret posted in chat must be rotated and retired; it was not copied into the project. |
| **Live YouCam integration** | No provider task was submitted as part of this change. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Dashboard usability and account details)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Studio category filters** | Category selection now filters the dashboard grid, announces the selected category with `aria-pressed`, and retains a visible keyboard focus ring. |
| **App theme consistency** | Restored the original white, coral, and red styling across app pages using the existing app theme tokens; the dashboard banner remains intact. |
| **Login prompts** | Removed the dashboard account creation link and the sidebar sign-in/account action. |
| **Login route** | Removed the `/login` page and configured a Next.js redirect to `/app`; removed landing-page login buttons and login/password-reset mode from the signup form. |
| **Guest app access** | Removed the remaining middleware gate that sent guests from `/app` to `/login`, preventing a redirect loop and allowing guest access. |
| **Sidebar account and usage** | Removed the fixed guest/tier/quota values. The sidebar loads the authenticated profile and current usage endpoint, with loading, unavailable, and guest states. |
| **Sample imagery** | Hair uses the hair sample; Nails uses the manicure sample; the dashboard hero alt text now accurately describes the existing portrait crop. |
| **Keyboard and links** | Replaced nested link/button controls with styled links and added visible focus styling to dashboard actions. |
| **Full Look planner** | Added a visual board of selected items and clarified that it organizes multiple studio previews rather than rendering one combined image. |
| **Page inspiration sections** | Reduced the repeated section to two page-specific recommendations and tightened its spacing to limit unnecessary scrolling. |

### Verification and remaining items

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |
| **Login URL** | Confirmed `/login` returns a 307 redirect to `/app`. |
| **Guest dashboard** | Confirmed `/app` now returns HTTP 200 without a login redirect. |
| **Production build** | Next.js compilation could not start because Windows returned `spawn EPERM`; this workspace has previously required an unsandboxed build. |
| **Responsive visual check** | Not completed in this session. |
| **New dashboard banner image** | Still pending: image generation CLI requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which is not configured locally. Existing banner and image were preserved. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-01 (Studio preview clarity)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Item preview framing** | Added a tightly cropped display-only preview using the segmentation mask bounds. Original full-resolution source, transparent, and white-background images remain unchanged for private storage and YouCam requests. |
| **Side-by-side preview** | Added clear labels for the selected item and user photo, stronger card framing, and a directional connector. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | Passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | Passed. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Quota errors and studio framing)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Supabase endpoint** | Corrected the ignored local `.env` project URL from the Supabase Dashboard URL to the project's API URL; set the matching public URL for browser-side Supabase Auth. No credentials were added to source control. |
| **Local development quota** | When the Supabase quota schema is missing in development, usage now falls back to a process-local daily counter. Production still fails with an instruction to apply the database migrations. |
| **Preview framing** | The user's full photo now uses `object-contain` so the head and feet aren't cropped. The item lifter keeps the dominant horizontal garment cluster when a reference contains multiple separate subjects; shoe pairs remain intact. |

### Verification and deployment requirement

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Usage endpoint** | `GET /api/usage` returned HTTP 200 and the local guest quota after correcting the project URL. |
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Production quota persistence** | Apply `supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql` and `supabase/migrations/002_private_storage.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. The development fallback is not shared across server instances and is not suitable for production. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Single-item garment extraction)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Repeated garment views** | Replaced the horizontal-only component grouping with a two-dimensional proximity check around the largest garment region. This prevents separate repeated poses on a reference sheet from all being retained just because they share a horizontal row. Nearby fragments of the primary garment remain. |
| **Mask alignment and source fidelity** | Fixed extraction to read the segmentation model's single-channel mask correctly and align it to source dimensions. The previous four-channel assumption sampled the wrong mask pixels, distorting the cutout. Original image RGB pixels are preserved; only the corrected mask is applied. |
| **Try-on reference fidelity** | Dress, shoe, and bag requests now send the untouched selected reference photo to YouCam. The segmented white-background image remains for the local preview and wardrobe save, but is no longer used as the API reference where it can remove product details. |
| **Cutout edge quality** | Added a subtle 5×5 Gaussian alpha feather to reduce pixel stair-steps around the isolated item while preserving opaque interior pixels and original image color. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |
| **Try-on visual fidelity** | Needs a fresh YouCam try-on to confirm the provider output with the untouched garment reference. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Low-resolution makeup photos)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Makeup input sizing** | Uploaded photos are cropped using the chosen zoom and smoothly resized to a 1024-pixel longest side before upload. Tall photos focus on the upper body to help small faces meet YouCam Makeup VTO's minimum face-width requirement; the original upload remains unchanged. |
| **Makeup photo guidance and zoom** | Replaced technical-only upload wording with plain-language photo guidance and added an accessible zoom slider. The selected zoom/crop is what Makeup VTO receives, while full-body previews remain available in Dress and Bag studios. |
| **Full Look expectations** | Clarified that Full Look currently organizes separate studio previews and does not merge them into one composite image. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Photo framing and multi-look guidance)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Makeup photo instructions** | Replaced technical dimension jargon with plain-language face framing guidance and file size/format requirements. |
| **Face zoom control** | Added an accessible zoom slider. The selected face-focused crop is sent to Makeup VTO; the original photo remains untouched. |
| **Full Look scope** | Clarified that selected items currently open separate studios and produce separate previews rather than a single merged image. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Combined Full Look workflow)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **One-photo workflow** | Full Look now accepts one full-body photo, lets the user choose Dress, Bag, and/or Makeup, and supports sample or custom dress/bag references. |
| **Sequential YouCam tasks** | The page runs the selected API stages in order. Bag and makeup operate on focused crops of the current result, then those images are softly blended back, preserving earlier selected changes. |
| **Progress and cost clarity** | Added per-stage progress, empty/loading/success/error states, a combined-image download, a quota precheck before any paid stage begins, and a note that each selected category uses one app quota plus provider API units. |
| **Safe image handoff** | Existing server routes only return compositing image data when the combined-look flow explicitly requests it; result downloads are server-side and restricted to YouCam's S3 result hosts. API credentials remain server-only. |
| **Other studios** | Kept hair, eye colour, jewelry, and nail studios accessible from the Full Look page. |

### Verification and limits

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |
| **Live YouCam composite** | Not run; verifying it would submit chargeable YouCam tasks and consume the selected quota. The page runs that work only after the user chooses Create Combined Look. |
| **Combined categories** | Dress, bag, and makeup are composited. Other studios remain individually available and are not yet part of the composite workflow. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (PNG support in Hair Studio)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Hair photo uploads** | Hair Studio now accepts PNG and JPEG for both the user's photo and hairstyle reference. The browser converts each to a high-quality JPEG capped at 1024 px before YouCam requests and before saving a hair reference, matching the provider's JPEG input requirement. |
| **Upload guidance** | Hair photo labels now say JPG or PNG, matching what the page accepts. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed. |
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Earring VTO InvalidParameters)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Earring task payload** | Added the required `source_info` and `object_infos` metadata, pairing each with the already selected source and reference file ID or URL. Enabled the documented automatic earring background removal parameter. |
| **Root cause** | The route sent only `src_file_*` and `ref_file_*` selectors. The official Earring VTO schema also requires source and object metadata, which explains YouCam's `InvalidParameters` response. |

### Verification and limits

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Official schema** | Confirmed required fields against Perfect Corp's Earring VTO OpenAPI schema. |
| **Live YouCam task** | Not submitted; it consumes provider units. Confirm with a normal earring try-on when ready. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Earring image clarity)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Try-on result preview** | Removed the fixed portrait crop so landscape and close-up results retain their full frame and natural proportions inside the available preview space. |
| **Sample selection** | Enlarged product detail in the earring sample tiles while keeping the original full-resolution product images as the API references. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Diff whitespace** | `git diff --check` passed. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Makeup VTO invalid_parameter)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Makeup effect payloads** | Removed `shimmerDensity` and `shimmerSize` from eyeliner and eyeshadow palettes; those fields are not part of the official Makeup VTO effect schema for those categories. Highlighter shimmer controls remain, where they are supported. |
| **Engine error detail** | The Makeup error now includes YouCam's `error_message` when the task response provides one, to make future failures actionable. |

### Verification and limits

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Official API schema** | Compared the affected effect properties with Perfect Corp's Makeup VTO v1.0 schema. |
| **Live Makeup task** | Not submitted; the user can retry the corrected look in the app. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Makeup gloss palette validation)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Gloss palettes** | Added the engine-required `transparencyIntensity` value to every gloss lipstick palette in Makeup Studio and the Full Look builder. |
| **Error source** | The live provider response identified the exact missing value: `effects.lip_color.palettes[0].transparencyIntensity`. |
| **Verification** | Checked every gloss lipstick effect in `src` and ran `git diff --check`; did not submit another provider task. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Makeup preview sharpness)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Source detail** | The Makeup crop no longer upscales every selected image to 1024 px; it keeps the captured pixels and only downsizes to fit YouCam's documented limits (width under 1920 px and height under 1080 px). |
| **Skin smoothing** | Lowered skin-smooth strength in all makeup looks, including Full Look's makeup stage, to reduce the airbrushed/soft appearance while keeping the effect available. |
| **Result display** | The result stays inside the preview frame without forced filling/cropping or enlargement, so its native sharpness is preserved as much as the display size allows. |
| **Verification** | Compared the input dimension caps with Perfect Corp's Makeup VTO docs and ran `git diff --check`; no paid live task submitted. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Makeup minimum crop dimensions)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Minimum image size** | Makeup photo preparation now keeps a squarer crop and scales it up only as much as necessary when its shorter side would be below YouCam's runtime-reported 320 px minimum. It still stays within the documented 1919 px width / 1079 px height caps. |
| **Upload guidance** | The page now asks for an image at least 320 × 320 px for a crisp result. |
| **Verification** | Ran `git diff --check`; no live YouCam task submitted. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Makeup look gallery expansion)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **New looks** | Added Soft Glam, Rosewater, and After Hours with distinct blush, eyeshadow, lip, and lash combinations. Effect values reuse supported Makeup VTO v1.0 categories, palettes, and catalog pattern labels. |
| **Gallery visuals** | Enlarged the inspiration image area, added finish tags and selection indicators, and clarified the range of looks and total count. |
| **Verification** | Ran `git diff --check` and loaded the Makeup page; no provider task submitted. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Email and password sign-in)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Sign-in page** | Added `/login` with the existing Mirror Moment blue-and-white visual system and responsive layout. |
| **Authentication method** | At the time of this update, sign-in used email and password through Supabase `signInWithPassword`; superseded by the SQLite account update below. |
| **Feedback and accessibility** | Added required labeled fields, password visibility control via the shared input, loading feedback, inline authentication/network errors, and an accessible success announcement. |

### Verification and limits

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Page response** | `GET /login` returned HTTP 200 from the local development server. |
| **Auth credentials** | No sign-in was attempted; it requires user credentials. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (SQLite email and password accounts)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Local accounts** | Sign-up and sign-in now use SQLite at `data/mirror-moment.sqlite` by default, configurable with `SQLITE_DB_PATH`. Passwords are stored as scrypt hashes with per-account salts; sessions use random opaque tokens stored hashed in SQLite and an HTTP-only SameSite cookie. |
| **Account pages** | Replaced the OAuth signup card with email/password signup, connected `/login` to the SQLite session API, and added sign-out in Settings. |
| **Account-aware routes** | Profile preferences are stored in SQLite. Quota identity and private asset ownership come from the SQLite session. Supabase remains a server-only store for try-on records and private cloud assets; service-role queries explicitly filter by the SQLite account ID. |
| **Database compatibility** | Added `supabase/migrations/003_sqlite_auth_user_ids.sql` to remove Auth-only foreign keys so SQLite account UUIDs can own existing Supabase rows. Existing Supabase Auth accounts do not automatically migrate into SQLite. |
| **Runtime and privacy** | Requires Node.js 24.14 or newer for built-in `node:sqlite`; local credential files and private local photos are git-ignored. |

### Verification and limits

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Production database migration** | Not applied remotely. Apply migration 003 in the Supabase SQL editor before signed-in users save cloud wardrobe, hair, or look records. |
| **Persistent deployment storage** | SQLite file must live on a persistent disk. Serverless/ephemeral filesystems can lose accounts when instances are replaced; configure `SQLITE_DB_PATH` to a durable mounted volume before deployment. |
| **TypeScript and routes** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; `/login` and `/signup` returned HTTP 200, and auth API routes compiled and correctly rejected GET with HTTP 405. |
| **Credential flow** | No account was created and no sign-in was attempted. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Full Look bag crop clarity)

### What changed

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Bag person framing** | Tightened the Full Look bag input to a centered head-to-waist 3:4 crop, while retaining the normalized crop coordinates for compositing the result back into the matching region. |
| **Visible crop preview** | Full Look now displays the actual person crop sent to Bag VTO before the task runs; after a selected dress stage, this preview refreshes to the post-dress image crop used for the bag request. |
| **Reference guidance** | Added instructions for custom bag references: one unobstructed bag should occupy at least a quarter of the image height; YouCam performs product/background recognition on the reference. |
| **Similar crop paths reviewed** | Makeup uses its own face crop and matching normalized blend region after bag; dress remains full-body. Bag and makeup are applied in the same stage order used by the final composite. |

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| **Bag API observation** | The latest development server log showed `/api/bag-tryon` returning HTTP 200; the request reached a successful response, so the reported issue was in crop visibility/framing rather than task creation. |
| **TypeScript and page** | `npx tsc --noEmit` passed; `/app/full-look` returned HTTP 200. |
| **Provider task** | No additional YouCam task submitted. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Landing → sign-in → dashboard flow)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Landing calls to action** | The landing page's “Try it free” buttons now open `/login`. |
| **Dashboard access** | `/app` and its nested pages now require a valid SQLite account session and redirect signed-out visitors to `/login`. |
| **Existing sessions** | Signed-in users who open `/login` or `/signup` are sent directly to `/app`; new users can create an account from the sign-in page and continue to the dashboard. |
| **Verification** | Reviewed landing links, session lookup, and server-side route guard. No credentials were used and no test suite was run. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Landing page photography)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Hero cards** | Replaced the colored SVG placeholders with local fashion, bag, and beauty photos already in the public asset library. |
| **Style gallery** | Replaced the illustrated before/after boxes with three real image cards for occasion outfits, accessories, and beauty. The captions now describe style categories rather than implying a generated before/after result. |
| **Theme and assets** | Preserved the existing blue-and-white palette and used local images through Next Image. |
| **Reduced motion** | Disabled floating and hover movement when the device requests reduced motion. |
| **Verification** | Confirmed image paths exist and reviewed the landing page component. No test suite was run. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Landing try buttons enter sign-in flow)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Landing CTAs** | Changed “Try a dress now” and “Try your own” to route through `/login`, matching the requested landing → sign-in → dashboard flow. |
| **Verification** | Confirmed all landing-page try CTAs now point to `/login`. No test suite was run. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Keep sign-in route reachable)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Auth-page routing** | Removed automatic redirects from `/login` and `/signup`. The dashboard still redirects signed-out visitors to `/login`, while users can now always reach the email/password form. |
| **Cause** | `/login` redirected to `/app` while the dashboard guard redirected back to `/login`; a `next.config.mjs` redirect was keeping that loop active. |
| **Verification** | Removed the configured redirect and confirmed the loop in local HTTP responses before the change. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-02 (Login red-and-white theme)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Login palette** | Applied the dashboard theme scope to the login page so its blue accents and aurora become the existing coral-red and white palette without changing shared tokens globally. |
| **Verification** | Confirmed the login route responds after the auth redirect fix. No test suite was run. |

## Session Update — 2026-11-08 (HackTheFashion scope)

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Track focus** | Centered the project on Try-On Commerce: dress try-on, wardrobe, and saved looks. |
| **Dashboard** | Replaced the 10-studio claim and beauty-focused entry cards with working links to the fashion flow, wardrobe, and saved results. Category buttons now filter these three destinations. |
| **Landing page** | Replaced beauty and accessory promotion with garment, wardrobe, and saved-look examples. Removed the unimplemented friend-voting claim. |
| **Repository guidance** | Rewrote the README around the current Next.js app and corrected `.env.example` to match the server environment variable names. Removed unsubstantiated skin analysis and benchmark claims. |
| **API requirement** | Left the provider integration unchanged. The Devpost page still contains an API-name placeholder, so organizer confirmation is needed before claiming compliance. |
| **Out of scope** | Other styling routes remain in the code but are no longer promoted in the primary navigation or dashboard. |
| **Verification** | No tests or build were run. |
